                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      Why does the sun’s position change when looked atthe same place and time? Should the sun stay at the same place? The sun changesposition because of thephenomena called analemma. Analemma is a diagram ofthe sun’s position relative to afixed location and time throughout the year. Thisis one of the reasons why Earth has 4seasons.
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      One of the factors that affect the sun’s positionis the elliptical orbit of Earth. Earth’s orbit is not a perfect circle like many wouldbelieve, but it is oblong or elliptical inshape. Because of its shape, the distance betweenthe Earth and Sun changes. TheEarth is closest to the Sun at around January whileit is farthest from the Sun aroundJuly. Thus, if we were to track the sun’s positionat the same place and time, theanalemma happens.
                  </p>
  
                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      The Earth’s axial tilt also influences the sun’s position.The Earth’s angle isn’tstraight up but tilted around 22 to 24 degrees, whenthe axial tilt is about 23.5 degrees,the northern hemisphere experiences summer and warmweather while the southernhemisphere experiences winter and cold weather. Thismeans that the sun’s distancei.e. the analemma phenomenon affects the Earth’s seasons.
                  </p>
  
                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      The seasons of the Earth happen because of the analemmaphenomenon. Theelliptical orbit and the axial tilt play a role inaffecting the sun’s position and distance tothe Earth. Without the analemma phenomena, the 4 seasonswouldn’t happen.
                      </p>
  
                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      The Remnants of the Solar System, described as Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud showsthat the Solar System is bigger than what we know. This is based around the furthest objectthat takes the orbit around the sun, based on the Sun's gravitational pull.  Everything that gets affected by the Sun's gravity is part of the Solar System.This edge of the  Solar  System  is  well  past  Pluto  and  even  beyond  the  Kuiper  Belt.  Though  we  believe  there  are  thousands  of these  small  objects  beyond  the  Solar  System,  we  haven't  found  a  big  fraction  of  them yet because  they  are  so  far away. The smaller objects can lead us to a much bigger planet. The more we discover, the better we will understand and see what's beyond our Solar System.

                      My co-writer for this magazine is Michael Jacob Delos Santos. He loves to
                      draw animals, people, backgrounds, buildings, and robots. His favorite games are
                      Roblox, Minecraft, and an AI version of Dungeons and Dragons. He also likes to make
                      games and listen to LoFi music. He watches cooking videos and parkour videos, and
                      finally he likes to sleep because honestly why not? His interests had garnered over
                      the years all thanks to his experiences with his friends and family
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      When he was 10, he went to the beach with his friends and stayed there for
                      three days. They all relaxed, played board games and sang Christian songs and
                      praised God. Then, when he was 11, he stayed in Cebu with his family to live with
                      his grandmother, the house she lived in look western, with a porch and white walls
                      and a fancy staircase. Next was in Baguio City, where he went to Camp John Hay in
                      the weekends to hang out with his friends, they played tabletop games on the first
                      night and on the 2nd day, they went zip lining. When he was 15, he introduced his
                      friends the experience of entering a convention by attending the Furry Pinas
                      Convention. Finally, when he was 16, he went to Taiwan to meet new people, enjoy
                      the food there, and experience different types of cultures

                      In most schools, the tracks they offer are usually the same: STEM, ABM, HUMSS, and GAS. CIIT, however, offers the tracks Media and Visual Arts, Animation, and Programming. Students that are aiming for the arts and technology industry will
                      need to pick a strand that is appropriate to what they aspire. Media and Visual Arts, Animation, and Programming strands are different and similar in terms of what
                      subjects they offer.
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      Media and Visual Arts tackle with arts and design and has what most other
                      art schools offer. Students will study the specialized subjects: Introduction to
                      Multimedia Arts, Art History, Drawing, Elements and Principles of Graphic Design, Digital Photography, Writing for New Media, Color Theory, Typography and Layout, and Fundamentals of Film and Video Production. This strand will lead students to
                      become photographers, graphic designers, and art directors.
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      Animation has students tackle a well grounded foundation in designing
                      characters, scenes, props and settings. The specialized subjects include History of
                      Graphic Design, Digital Animation, Introduction to Multimedia Arts, Digital
                      Storyboarding, 2D Animation, Color Theory, 3D Modelling, and Typography and
                      Layout. Animators, storyboard compositor, and animation directer are one of the
                      few careers this strand will lead.
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      Programming deals with code, the creation of new programs and apps and
                      software development. This strand’s subject include Introduction to Computing, Computer Programming 1 & 2, Application, Development and Emerging
                      Technologies, Web Design and Scripting, Architecture and Organization of Machine
                      Language, Web Programming, Introduction to Game Design, and Information
                      Management. You can become a system programmer, software engineer or a game
                      developer if you pursue this strand.
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      With how different these strands are, it is important to know about them so
                      that we can decide carefully on what career we want. All of these strands teach
                      general academic subjects and they are all taught in a lab-based format. These
                      strands differ in subjects: subjects that partain in what career you want.

                      A student is usually the one that makes up the school, they come to school to
                      learn, meet other students, become friends with them and discover new interests. There are many types of students that can be described by their behaviour, interests, and overall participation in class. These types of students can still be found even in
                      an online environment during this stressful situation.
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      There is always that type of student that cracks jokes every so often or
                      disrupts the class; the funny student. Funny students are very talkative to others and
                      often have a lot of friends. They can sometimes be bothersome during the class, making noise or disturbing other students.
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      In the same way, there is the enthusiastic student. An enthusiastic student is
                      the one with the straight A’s, perfect attendance, and is very extroverted. They are
                      often picked to be the leader of the class’ section and are very motivated to do their
                      tasks successfully. They are also very friendly to their teachers and often ask
                      questions to them.
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      On the other hand, there are students that do the opposite; the
                      procrastinator student. These students delay their tasks and sometimes participate
                      in class. Their internet is always seemingly slow and unresponsive, which may lead
                      them to actually having to delay what they need to do in order to try and get their
                      internet to work.
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      Similarly, there’s the insecure student, a more drastic version of the
                      procrastinator student. These students are very shy, they rarely open their cameras
                      and barely talk in their microphone. They are not confident and are very anxious
                      towards other students, and they also overthink if they are under pressure from
                      school works.
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      These types of students are still present even in the current situation which
                      led to classes being conducted online. There will be students that are very active like
                      the funny and enthusiastic ones, and there will be students that are having a hard
                      time getting used to the online format. Students are all unique from one another, even if times are hard.

                <p class="text-justify lead">
                  My mother has created a new recipe for baby back ribs, it is a tradition for
                  her cook it every weekend and my family has loved it since. This recipe is very easy
                  to follow and is perfect for big gatherings.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify lead">
                  The first step is to preheat the oven to 250° F and prepare the ingredients: 1
                  kg baby back ribs, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp cumin, 2 tsp
                  paprika, 1 tbs rosemary, 1 tsp salt, 1 pack all-in-one seasoning, a slice of lemon, and
                  hickory sauce for the glaze. Then, marinade the ribs with lemon and salt for 30
                  minutes.
              </p>

                <p class="text-justify lead">
                  After the ribs have been marinated, make the dry rub by mixing brown sugar, black pepper, cumin, paprika, rosemary, salt, and all-in-one seasoning. Then, rub it
                  on the ribs and place it on a baking pan, wrapping it in foil. Bake the ribs for 2 to 3
                  hours.
                </p>

                  <p class="text-justify lead">
                      The next step, after the ribs are baked, remove it from the oven. Remove the
                      excess liquid from the pan and start adding hickory sauce on one side of the ribs. Then put the ribs back in the oven (without foil) and bake for 10 minutes. Finally, repeat this step for
