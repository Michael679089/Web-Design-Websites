            <hr>
            <p class="pb-2">
                Eiichiro Oda (Japanese: Â∞æÁî∞ Ê†Ñ‰∏ÄÈÉé, Hepburn: Oda Eiichir≈ç, born January 1, 1975) is a Japanese manga artist and the creator
                of the series One Piece (1997‚Äìpresent). With more than 480 million tank≈çbon copies in circulation worldwide, One Piece
                is both the best-selling manga and the best-selling comic series of all time, in turn making Oda one of the best-selling
                fiction authors. The series' popularity resulted in Oda being named one of the manga artists that changed the
                history of manga.
            </p>
    
            <h4>Early Life</h4>
            <p class="pb-2">
                Eiichiro Oda was born on January 1, 1975 in Kumamoto, Japan. He said that at age four he resolved to become a manga
                artist in order to avoid having to get a "real job". His biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series Dragon
                Ball. He recalls that his interest in pirates was probably sparked by the popular TV animation series titled Vicky
                the Viking. He submitted a character named Pandaman for Yudetamago's classic wrestling manga Kinnikuman. Pandaman was
                not only used in a chapter of the manga but would later return as a recurring cameo character in Oda's own works.
            </p>
    
            <h4> Personal Life </h4>
            <p class="pb-2">
                At the age of 17, Oda submitted his work Wanted! and won several awards, including second place in the coveted Tezuka
                Award (He was called Kikondo Tsukihimizu, that means roughly Thufrisat Montuewed (Japanese surnames are usually before
                first name)). That got him into a job at the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine, where he originally worked as assistant to
                Shinobu Kaitani's series Suizan Police Gang before moving to Masaya Tokuhiro on Jungle King Tar-chan and Mizu no
                Tomodachi Kappaman, which gave him an unexpected influence on his artistic style. At the age of 19, he began working
                as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki on Rurouni Kenshin, before winning the Hop Step Award for new manga artists. Watsuki
                credits Oda for helping create the character Honj≈ç Kamatari who appears in Rurouni Kenshin.
                
                During this time, Oda drew two pirate-themed one-shot stories called "Romance Dawn", which were published in Akamaru
                Jump and Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump respectively in late 1996. "Romance Dawn" featured Monkey D. Luffy as the
                protagonist, who then became the protagonist of One Piece.
                
                In 1997, One Piece began serialization in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump and has become not only one of the most popular manga in
                Japan, but the best-selling manga series of all time. It sold 100 million collected tank≈çbon volumes by February
                2005, over 200 million by February 2011, had 320,866,000 copies printed worldwide by December 2014, 430
                million volumes in circulation worldwide as of October 2017, 440 million copies sold as of May 2018 and 450
                million in print as of March 2019.
                
                Additionally, individual volumes of One Piece have broken publishing records in Japan. Volume 56 received the highest
                initial print run of any manga, 2.85 million copies, in 2009. Volume 57's print of 3 million in 2010 was the highest
                first print for any book in Japan, not just manga. A record that was broken several times by subsequent volumes and
                currently held by 67's 4.05 million initial printing in 2012. In 2013, the series won the 41st Japan Cartoonists
                Association Award Grand Prize, alongside Kimuchi Yokoyama's Nekodarake Nice.
                
                In a 2008 poll, conducted by marketing research firm Oricon, Oda was elected fifth most favorite manga artists of Japan.
                He shared the place with Yoshihiro Togashi, creator of YuYu Hakusho and Hunter √ó Hunter. In their 2010 poll on the
                Mangaka that Changed the History of Manga, Oda came in fourth.
                
                For the tenth One Piece animated theatrical film, Strong World, Oda created the film's story, drew over 120 drawings for
                guidance and insisted Mr. Children provide the theme song. Additionally, a special chapter of the manga was
                created and included in tank≈çbon volume 0, which was given free to attendees of the film and also contained his drawings
                for the film.
                
                Oda and Akira Toriyama created a 2007 crossover one-shot called Cross Epoch, that contains characters from Toriyama's
                Dragon Ball and Oda's One Piece. In 2013, they each designed a Gaist character for the video game Gaist Crusher.

            <hr>
            <p class="pb-2">
                One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's
                Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine since July 1997, with its individual chapters compiled into 98 tank≈çbon volumes as of
                February 2021. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber
                after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his crew of pirates, named the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the
                Grand Line in search of the world's ultimate treasure known as "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the
                Pirates.
            </p>

            <h4>Premise</h4>
            <p class="pb-2">
                The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man who, inspired by his childhood idol and powerful pirate "Red Haired"
                Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the titular treasure and proclaim himself the King of the
                Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy rescues and befriends a swordsman
                named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the One Piece. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a navigator
                and thief; Usopp, a sniper and a pathological liar; and Vinsmoke Sanji, a perverted chef. They acquire a ship named the
                Going Merry and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on
                their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, a doctor and anthropomorphized
                reindeer; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeletal musician and
                swordsman; and Jimbei, a fish-man helmsman and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Once the Going Merry
                becomes damaged beyond repair, the Straw Hat Pirates acquire a new ship named the Thousand Sunny. Together, they
                encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents and soldiers of the
                corrupt World Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.
            </p>

            <h4>Location/Setting üåé</h4>
            <div class="card">
                <img class="card-img-top img-sm" src="location of One Piece.png" alt="One Piece Location">
            </div>
            <p class="pb-2">
                The world of One Piece is populated by humans and many other races, such as fish-men and merfolk (two races of
                fish/human hybrids), dwarves, minks (a race of humanoids with animal features), and giants. It is covered by two vast
                oceans, which are divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line, which is also the only continent in the
                world. The Grand Line, a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line, further divides them into four seas:
                North Blue, East Blue, West Blue, and South Blue. Surrounding the Grand Line are two regions
                called Calm Belts, similar to horse latitudes, which experience almost no wind or ocean currents and are the
                breeding ground for huge sea creatures called sea kings. Because of this, the calm belts are very effective
                barriers for those trying to enter the Grand Line. However, navy ships, members of an intergovernmental organization
                known as the World Government, are able to use a sea-prism stone to mask their presence from the sea kings and
                can simply pass through the calm belts. All other ships are forced to take a more dangerous route, going through a
                mountain at the first intersection of the Grand Line and the Red Line, a canal system known as Reverse Mountain.[Jp
                13] Sea water from each of the four seas runs up that mountain and merges at the top to flow down a fifth canal and
                into the first half of the Grand Line, called Paradise because how it compared to the second half. The second half of
                the Grand Line, beyond the second intersection with the Red Line, is known as the New World.
                
                The currents and weather of the Grand Line's open sea are extremely unpredictable, whereas in the vicinity of islands
                the climate is stable. The magnetic fields within the Grand Line cause normal compasses to malfunction, making it
                even more difficult to navigate, and instead a special compass called a Log Pose must be used. The Log
                Pose functions by locking on to one island's magnetic field and then locking on to another island's magnetic field.[11]
                The time for it to set depends on the island. This process can be bypassed by obtaining an Eternal Pose, a
                Log Pose variation that is permanently set to a specific island and never changes.
                
                The world of One Piece includes animals that function like devices. Transponder Snails are snail-like animals
                that act like a rotary phone, fax machine, or camera. Dials, the shells of certain sky-dwelling animals,
                can be used to store kinetic energy, wind, sound, images, heat, and the like and have various applications.
